ipaddrmgr
=========

ip address manager - written in Go, as a bit of a learning/experiment, this program is intended to send ip addresses from computers
which are assigned ip addresses dynamically and may not have a host name assigned.

The original idea was that it might work well on Raspberry Pi computers or the like.
